# Books on Vacation Project 

## Objective

A friend of mine asked for help picking out books to take on vacation. To help her choose books, I developed a Python algorithm to randomly choose three books from her predefined list. My further goal was to meet specific criteria: first, that each book came from a different genre; second, that the total page length was between 600 and 800 pages; third, that books higher up on her 'to-read' list were prioritized above those lower on her list. This approach was designed to provide a well-rounded collection of books that she could choose to take with her on vacation.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in implementing selection criteria to ensure specific attributes are met, facilitating precise item selection and task completion.
- Ability to navigate and manipulate data structures such as dictionaries and lists to organize information efficiently.
- Skill in designing algorithms that meet defined objectives, balancing multiple factors like genre diversity and page length.
- Competence in employing conditional statements to control program flow based on varying conditions and requirements.
- Experience in problem-solving by breaking down complex tasks into systematic steps for effective solution development.
- Advanced proficiency in Python programming through practical application and algorithm development.

## Steps

### Step One

I began by defining a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a book with its genre and page count.
